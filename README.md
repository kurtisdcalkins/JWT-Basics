## Description
In this course, John Smilga shows how to build servers and apps using Node.js and Express.js.

For the third project, the front-end was already built by John and the back-end was composed of much of the middleware created in projects one and two. Our task was to build a server that uses JWT authentication to create a login with authenticated response. The login and response were not exactly realistic, but allowed us to focus on how JWT authentication works and how to set it up.
